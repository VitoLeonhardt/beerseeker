Comments:

- the pagination is a bit wonky, as the Punk API doesn't give you the option of seeing how many results are there.
- the form fields could've been their own component, but I liked the simplicity.
- the tests are rather simple, but they're helpful - they also return some warnings, I'm a little unfamiliar with how react-testing-library works these days
