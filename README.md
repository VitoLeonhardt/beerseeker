# Frontend Remote Task

## Context

Beer lovers love to discover new beers. Help them by building a website where they easily can find and explore new exciting beer creations.
The list of beers should be based on the PUNK API (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)

## Product Requirements

As a beer lover I want to:
list beers from the PUNK API with name, image and first brew date displayed.
see the first 10 beers, with the ability to paginate (10 beers per page).
see the total amount of beers. - this doesn't seem to be possible, since page size is 80 at maximum and no endpoint for all beers
filter the beers by name.
filter the beers by first brew date.
see additional information of a single beer (description, abv, volume, food pairings)

## Your Mission

Create the React application that satisfies all must-have requirements above, plus any nice-to-have you wish to include.

For that, youâ€™ll need to make requests to a publicly-available [API] (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to get JSON content.

The API is known to have some limitations. If you are not able to implement a particular requirement, please provide a description of what and why you could not implements.

Optional: Host the website on the service of your choice (zeit, Heroku, AWS, GCloud, ...)
